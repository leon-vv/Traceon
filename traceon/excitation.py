"""The excitation module allows to specify the excitation (or element types) of the different physical groups (electrodes)
created with the `traceon.geometry` module. 

The possible excitations are as follows:

- Fixed voltage (electrode connect to a power supply)
- Voltage function (a generic Python function specifies the voltage as a function of position)
- Dielectric, with arbitrary electric permittivity
- Current coil, with fixed total amount of current (only in radial symmetry)
- Magnetostatic scalar potential
- Magnetizable material, with arbitrary magnetic permeability

Currently current excitations are not supported in 3D. But magnetostatic fields can still be computed using the magnetostatic scalar potential.

Once the excitation is specified, it can be passed to `traceon.solver.solve_bem` to compute the resulting field.
