"""The excitation module allows to specify the excitation (or element types) of the different physical groups (electrodes)
created with the `traceon.geometry` module. Currently only electrostatic excitations are supported.

The possible excitations are as follows:

- Fixed voltage (electrode connect to a power supply)
- Voltage function (a generic Python function specifies the voltage as a function of position)
- Dielectric, with arbitrary electric permittivity
- Floating conductor, with an arbitrary total charge on the surface

Once the excitation is specified, it can be passed to `traceon.solver.solve_bem` to compute the resulting field.
