"""The tracing module allows to trace electrons within any field type returned by the `traceon.solver` module. The tracing algorithm
used is RK45 with adaptive step size control [1]. The tracing code is implemented in C (see `traceon.backend`) and has therefore
excellent performance. The module also provides various helper functions to define appropriate initial velocity vectors and to
compute intersections of the computed traces with various planes.
