# Traceon

Traceon is a general software package used for numerical electron optics. Its main feature is the implementation of the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to quickly calculate the surface charge distribution. The program supports both radial symmetry and general three-dimensional geometries. Electron tracing can be done very quickly using accurate radial series interpolation in both geometries. The electron trajectories obtained can help determine the aberrations of the optical components under study.

Traceon is completely free to use and open source. The source code is distributed under the `AGPLv3` license.
