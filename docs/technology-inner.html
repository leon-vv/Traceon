<h2>Boundary element method</h2>
<span>Unlike traditional finite element methods, Traceon only needs the boundary mesh to compute the fields. This greatly reduces
the problem size and improves accuracy.</span>

<h2>Fast Multipole Method</h2>
<span>Traceon employs the Fast Multipole Method to scale simulations to millions of triangles. A new and high performance
implementation of this algorithm has been developed.</span>

<h2>Accurate and fast particle tracing</h2>
<span>Traceon uses advanced mathematical formulas to make accurate approximations of the fields around the optical axis. Unique for the boundary element
method is that these approximations can be made analytically.</span>

<h2>Magnetostatics</h2>
<span>Thanks to the method of reduced potential, Traceon also allows magnetostatic fields to be computed. Also modules which combine electrostatic and magnetostatic
elements are fully supported.</span>

<h2>Convenient Python interface</h2>
<span>Traceon is distributed as a package for the programming language you know and love: Python. This familiar programming language
allows complete automation of every workflow.</span>

<h2>Parametric mesher</h2>
<span>Traceon comes with a parametric meshes which produces highly structured meshes. In this manner geometric symmetries are 
easily reproduced in your mesh. Importing standard mesh formats is also supported.</span>
